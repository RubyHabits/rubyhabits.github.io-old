*Just as every learner is different, every ruby has its habit.* We are a Ruby learning group located in Vienna. We welcome everyone, from ruby newbies to fully-fledged rubyists, to delve into the wonderful world of programming and learn ruby together.

At every meet we will advance a little, with the ultimate goal to achieve a mastery of Ruby. *As we are all at different levels of learning, we'll be working in groups*, with more advanced members always available to help out should anyone get stuck.

If you join our mailing list, we'll send you our "task" for the meet up before the meet up begins and the conclusions we reached at out meet up, the following day. This way, *if anyone is unable to attend, they'll still be able to join in.*

We will be posting all our working materials on our [Github page](https://github.com/RubyHabits). Feel free to follow us on social media to keep track of what we're up to!
