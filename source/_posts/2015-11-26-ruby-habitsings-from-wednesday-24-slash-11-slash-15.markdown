Hello! We had a cozy meetup last night and learned some neat pointers. Below is a summary of what we got up to:

[Stefan](https://twitter.com/informatom) brought along a special little USB stick as an idea for [Rubystarters](https://github.com/RubyStarters). What's cool about it is that it's meant to be a little [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/) environment with Ruby, Rails and pals all set up from the get-go. He proposed that having an ISO that you can boot from is a simple way to ensure that everyone has a stable and equal environment. You can also pick a theme in Ubuntu MATE to match what you're used to. This is a really cool idea!

One interesting caveat that came from this, however, is that of 32 vs. 64 bit architectures. Stefan had prepared a 32 bit one to be as cross-compatible as possible. However, it seems that the 32 bit one won't boot from a recent Macbook Pro. Seems we need both!

Moving on, we made some progress with [Where2Help](https://github.com/where2help/where2help). [Max](https://twitter.com/klappradla) added a really need `table-clickable` property to the `admin` view.

Finally, some minor tips and recommendations:

- [HAML](http://haml.info/), a neat alternative to writing oodles of HTML. A personal favorite.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/), an open source alternative to Sublime Text. Made by the folks at Github, too!
- [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a _barebones_ (sorrynotsorry) simple `CSS` boilerplate for getting a quick website up.
- [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/), an extensive framework for making websites using pure HTML elements.
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), a SASS-based alternative to Bootstrap, where you can add on grids and other elements as needed.

In other news, myself and [Pilar](https://twitter.com/althaire) will be gone in two weeks, but other happy Ruby Rabbits will be there. Join them! Same Ruby Habits time (every two Wednesdays at 18:30), same Ruby Habits place (Sektor5).

Have a wonderful two weeks, 'til next time!
