Hi everyone! So we just had our first session and looks like it was a success! Thank you so much to everyone who came, we're so happy all of you could make it. 

If you couldn't make it don't worry, we have a recap of our first session below:

We started the session off with a big thank you to Rochuspark for letting us hold the meet up in their lovely meeting room and to Vienna.rb for giving us the inspiration to start the group, bring our organizational team together and supporting us during our first meet up.

Following this we had a round of introductions from everyone who attended:

> **Pilar** - Biology student, recently fascinated by the world of programming. Ruby newbie since March 2014. Trying to learn Ruby in a fun way with friends.

> **Ramón** - professional software engineer, teaches kids programming and works at  [Incredible Bee](http://incrediblebee.com/).

> **Babs** - project manager of  [Legacy Quest](http://www.playlegacyquest.com/). Works in the game industry and is on a mission to learn code.

> **Jonathan** - a programmer from Brasil, currently on an epic struggle with Windows 8 to let him use Ruby comfortably on his machine (without having a virtual machine slow everything down!)

> **Susi** - part of the [dailycious](http://dailycious.co/) team. Hoping to get better at Ruby to have a better idea of what the teams programmers are up to.

> **Birgit** - has been teaching kids to make computer games with Ramón, has experience with gosu and has started learning Python as well.

> **Shelly** - comes from Ireland, has experience with Python and has decided to learn more Ruby after attending vienna.rb's beginner workshop.

> **Yanko** - a professional programmer, has been using Ruby mainly for scripts until now. His fascination with computers stuck with him from a young age and now he's doing what he loves.

> **Laura** - After attending the first Rails Girls event in Vienna, she took a leap and now works as a developer for a small company in Vienna. She co-organizes  [vienna.rb](http://vienna-rb.at)!

> **Mirjam** - the organizer of Rails Girls St. Pölten and web developer. Wants to learn more Ruby in a fun way (ie. not staring at textbooks)

> **Alex** - tried the university path but it just wouldn't stick. Spent some time trying new fields (figuring out the secret behind giant bubbles) and, after having a look at Why's guide, is ready to delve further into Ruby.

After everybody got to know each other, Pilar went into detail about [how the meet ups will run](https://github.com/RubyHabits/Slides/blob/master/1st%20Edition%20-%20Introduction.pdf),  what to bring with you to the meet ups and what you should do once you get home

 We then moved on to Ramon showing us some really cool stuff you can do with Ruby, including scripts that make your life much easier and apps made simple with Rubymotion.

A short break followed, for all our members to have a chance to refresh their drinks, snack bowls to refill and have a little chat.

When we got back to it we went through a brief history of Ruby and its extensions, what Ruby and gems are, and had a look at a few well known gems.

Finally, we took a look at some of the potential projects we might work on as group, including:

- Making and running ruby programs
- Object oriented programming crash course
- Making a Sinatra web app
- A git-tastic intro session
- Making fun games with gosu

Although some of our members had to leave a bit earlier, the party kept going and we stayed a good while discussing more projects we'd like to work on, got to know each other a bit better and had a great time.
