We're a simple group that meets up on a hopefully regular basis to learn things related to ruby and programming in general. By preparing exercises or small projects we can do during the meetup, we can get everyone involved.

Our goal is to be as open as possible, giving everyone a chance and space to speak up and ask questions. We also want to welcome people from all walks of life, and all skill levels. 

We welcome all feedback, and have a strict [Code of Conduct]({{ root_url }}/code-of-conduct).
